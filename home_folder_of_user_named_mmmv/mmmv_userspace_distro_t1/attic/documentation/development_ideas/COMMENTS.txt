The documentation in this folder is mostly about future development ideas 
of the mmmv_userspace_distro_t1. It may also include incomplete
drafts of various documentation, including documentation of
subprojects that do not have any code. The documentation in this folder 
is public, but it's meant to be read only by the initial author 
of the mmmv_userspace_distro_t1, Martin.Vahi@softf1.com, 
so it is mostly in Estonian. 

This whole folder should be deleted from deployment copies 
of the mmmv_userspace_distro_t1. As You currently are 
reading the content of this folder, then please do not
bother to read the rest of the documentation in this folder.

Thank You for reading this COMMENTS.txt
