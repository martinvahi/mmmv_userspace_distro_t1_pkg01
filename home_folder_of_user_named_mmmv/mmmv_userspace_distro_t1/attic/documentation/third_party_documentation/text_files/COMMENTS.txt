The start of the output of the 

    $MMMV_USERSPACE_DISTRO_T1_HOME/mmmv/bin/mmmv_ls_doc_Bash_color_codes_t1.bash

has the introductory text that explains, what is Unicode,
how Unicode relates to text and some of the related caviats.

What regards to the

    ./text_based_encoding_formats

then just like there are many ways, how to 
encode positive whole numbers, there are
many ways, how to encode containers that
reside within each other. For example,
in stead of writing

    house contains room contains shelve contains book

it is possible to use a non-text based encoding format 
by creating folders and an xz-file like

    mkdir ./house ; wait 
    cd house
        mkdir ./room ; wait 
        cd ./room
            mkdir ./shelve ; wait 
            cd ./shelve
                mkdir ./book ; wait 
                cd ./book
    cd ./../../../../
    tar -cf ./house.tar ./house ; wait
    xz ./house.tar

Another example of a non-text based structured data format is the
