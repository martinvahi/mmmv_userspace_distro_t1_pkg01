The only purpose of repackaging the GNU grep for the
mmmv_userspace_distro_t1 applications collection is to allow the use
of the GNU grep binary that has been compiled so that all CPU specific
compiler optimisations have been enabled. The GNU grep is so frequently
used program that it makes sense to really take advantage of all of the
hard work that CPU engineers and compiler backend developers have put
into their masterpieces. If not for speed, then just for saving some
electricity, possibly battery life :-)

From dependency graph point of view this whole package, the repackaging
of the GNU grep, is a total oxymoron. Even the

    ./try_to_compile_GNU_grep_v_3_11_by_using_tautological.bash

depends on GNU grep, which is expected to be installed from operating
system package collection. File origin info:
