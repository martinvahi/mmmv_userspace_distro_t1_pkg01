# Address book in NeoMutt is part of the NeoMutt configuration

#source /home/ruusu/m_local/var/NeoMutt_epostikataloog/neomutt_formaadis_aadressiraamat.txt

# Addresses at the address book are described like that:

alias AstronomerGoo  Albert Coppernicus <einstein.hidingfrom@witchhunt.com>
alias SuperVillain Gold Finger <gold.finger@bond007.com>
