As of 2025_01 the 

    ./template_of_home_username_dot_dillo_dillorc

is expected to have a path of 

    $HOME/.dillo/dillorc

and the 

    ./template_of_home_username_dot_dillo-plus_dillorc

is expected to have a path of 

    $HOME/.dillo-plus/dillorc

except that the 

    $HOME/.dillo-plus/dillorc

does NOT need to be manually created, because it gets
crated automatically during Dillo+ installation.
